# ear-abnormalities

## Credits
**ear-landmark-detection-with-CNN** folder is based on https://github.com/kbulutozler/ear-landmark-detection-with-CNN. This was an existing model that we are hoping to tweak to work for our task of ear deformity classification.

The second model option is a transfer learning model from **resnet-18**[https://docs.pytorch.org/vision/main/models/generated/torchvision.models.resnet18.html]. We are replacing the classification head of the model and replacing it with a regression head.
